# hello-world
Repository for exploring GitHub.

I am a PhD student who would like to join the world of people who collaborate on code. Til now I have only written it by myself, for myself, and I aim to change these selfish ways. 

I enjoy camping a lot. If I could spend all my time outside in bare feet I would, but I live in Toronto, Canada, where it is far too cold to do that for six months of the year and the streets are unclean and full of perils.

I had to add some more to have a proper commit message.
